# Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)

This repository documents my journey of learning **Data Structures and Algorithms** for technical interviews.

I solve common interview problems, focusing on:
- Clear logic
- Optimized solutions
- Clean and readable code

---

## ✅ Problems Solved

- **Max Area Square**
- **Two Sum**

---

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- JavaScript
- Python (planned)

---

## 🎯 Goals
- Build strong DSA fundamentals
- Improve problem-solving skills
- Prepare for coding interviews
- Maintain a well-organized DSA reference repo

---

## 📌 Notes
- Each problem includes a clean implementation
- Solutions focus on optimal time & space complexity
- More problems will be added consistently

---

## 🚀 Progress
Learning step by step and pushing solutions regularly.
